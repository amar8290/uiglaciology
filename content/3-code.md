# Tips on coding
We generally use python for most of our core scientific computing needs.  We use anaconda as a package manager for installing and updating python, spyder, and necessary packages such as numpy, scipy, etc...  You can [learn more about managing and installing packages here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#).

Google is key for learning how to code.  Tim also recommends [scipy-lectures.org](https://scipy-lectures.org/) as a good consistent primer on a lot of fundamental coding tasks. The python website (python.org) also provides useful tutorials that are helpful for beginners.

Stack Overflow is an invaluable tool for for professional, beginner, and enthusiastic programmers. It is a question and answer platform used across the programming community to solve coding problems collaboratively.

[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) is a great tool for working with spatial data, like rasters and shapefiles.  It's free and has a lot of capability.
