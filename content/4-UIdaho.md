# Tips for life and work at the University of Idaho

Below is a list of tasks and activities that will help keep your time in grad school on track, and operating smoothly.

## On arriving at UI
- Get your VandalCard/student ID card.
- Get your lab key from Terry.
- Get your VandalCard set up for entry after-hours to McClure.


### After a couple months
- Apply to become a UI van driver- speak to Terry about taking the defensive driving course.

## In April of your first year
- Form a committee to help guide you through your graduate career.
    - For Ph.D. students, the committee will also supervise/contribute to your comprehensive exam.
    - Guidelines and forms for selecting a committee can be found [here](https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/cogs/COGS-Forms/Guides/Add-or-Change-Committee-members-7_2015.pdf?la=en&hash=B5499A9EC856A7EA15F291BA76865F31D815DF5E).
    - If your committee includes any non-UI researchers, they must additionally fill out [this](https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/cogs/COGS-Forms/non-ui-faculty-appointment.pdf?la=en&hash=7FB784C5B07202548E1ED515D173EBE4C02B33B1) form. 
- Create a graduate study plan and file it with the graduate school.

## Prepare a dissertation/thesis proposal
- By the end of the first year for M.S. students, and by the end of the second year for Ph.D. students.
- The dissertation proposal lays out the complete scope of your Ph.D. or M.S., including each paper/chapter that you will write, describes the methods and analyses you'll use to address these topics, and demonstrates that you have the skills to do the work or have a plan to develop those skills.
    - We expect that M.S. students will write and publish one paper by the time they graduate.
    - We expect that Ph.D. student will write and publish at least three papers.
- The goal of the dissertation proposal is to demonstrate that you have the scholarly sophistication to do Ph.D. level work.
    - One of the best ways to do this is to have already made significant progress towards your Ph.D. (ideally with a manuscript already complete and submitted to a journal).
    - One of the challenges of preparing a dissertation or thesis proposal is identifying and defining an appropriate scope.  Students commonly will attempt to do too much.  Prove that you have a sophisticated understanding of the scientific process by proposing work that advances your field and addresses a need for scholarship, but has well-defined boundaries.
- Approximately 1-2 weeks after turning the final version of your proposal to your committee, present this proposal orally to the committee and to the public.
    - The purpose of the oral presentation is to demonstrate your growth and development as an independent scientist,  convince your committee and the attending public that you have the capacity to do the work you've proposed, and that you're engaging in the advancement of your discipline.
    - After the oral presentation, you will have a meeting just with your committee to defend your proposal, and discuss the scope and your preparation for the work.


## For Ph.D. students, by the end of the second year
- Prepare to take your comprehensive exam.
- Prepare for your dissertation proposal.

## Before the end of each year in graduate school
- Hold a committee meeting, to update your committee on your progress, seek feedback on your work to date, and engage your committee in your entire professional development/trajectory.

## Graduating
- Apply to graduate.
- Format your thesis carefully.

# Introduction

- [Library Workshops](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/workshops/){:target="_blank"} 
- Background - 2016 Software Carpentry instructor training with [Northwest Knowledge Network](https://www.northwestknowledge.net/) 
    - Influenced how I teach and how I develop materials

### The Carpentries

The [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/){:target="_blank"} is an international volunteer organization that teaches basic tech skills for researchers, via workshops in three areas:

- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
- [Data Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org/)
- [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)

Computing and data skills are a growing part of every academic discipline making it necessary to incorporate in curriculum. 
The Carpentries fill the gaps in the basic training that can make research easier and more efficient--"to get more done in less time and with less pain" (Greg Wilson).
Importantly, they are committed to a particular method of teaching these skills that is informed by research and aims to build a positive learning community:

<p>The Carpentries develop and teach in-person, interactive, hands-on, two-day workshops for learning core data science and coding skills. Carpentries workshops are taught by volunteer Instructors, trained in pedagogy, who focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners. All our lessons are open source, hosted on GitHub, and collaboratively developed by our volunteer community.</p>
