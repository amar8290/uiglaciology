Here's an intro of what you'll find in these pages.

### These pages are modeled on a website produced by Evan Will at the UI library
Much of the content you'll find here is unmodified from Evan's original website: https://evanwill.github.io/tech-hands-on/

However, computing and data skills are a growing part of every discipline making it necessary to incorporate in curriculum. 

The [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is an international volunteer organization that collaboratively develops lessons and teaches two day workshops to fill that gap and support foundational tech skills in research. 
Over two decades the community has collected experience and evidence based approaches to teaching this content in a workshop setting.

This session will introduce some of concepts and techniques that can be adapted to other instructional contexts to support active learning of difficult technical topics.
